🧠Task 4- Neural style transfer 

This project demonstrates Neural Style Transfer using a pre trained deep learning model.NST is a computer version technique that blends the content of one image with the Style of another to produce a unique, stylized Output.

📌Objective 

To implement Neural Style Transfer using a pre trained convolutional Neural Network (VGG19) to generate an image that combines the content of a target image with Style of reference image.

🛠Tools and technologies:

▪️Python

▪️Tensorflow/PyTorch 

▪️OpenCV 

▪️Matplotlib 

🔍How It works 

🔸️ Load content and style images 

🔸️ Extract features using VGG19 

🔸️ Compute content loss and style loss

🔸️ Output the stylized image
